## Description

This portfolio website showcases my Front End Web Development skillset with recent work, upcoming projects and the site itself. So far, it is able to demonstrate my competency in writing HTML and CSS to develop a functioning webpage for a potential employer to view. It also highlights my understanding of the processes involved in maintaining a GitHub repository and contributing to projects from a local repo, significant for working as part of a team.

Apart from the purpose of the portfolio itself, this particular version (second to https://cariberrii.github.io/cari-fillingham-portfolio) acts as a challenge to customizing Bootstrap components to resemble and function similar to my original design and layout. 

This version required the use of Bootstrap components and flex displays to style the site layout and be responsive to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. In contrast to my first portfolio site, I adopted the mobile first approach to stay in line with Bootstrap's mobile first code. This was a great opportunity to explore the difference between designing a webpage as mobile first vs non-mobile first. A notable difference being the use of media queries required a minimum value in this instance instead of a maximum value as previous.

I have identified a number of challenges in regards to customizing a pre-built code set to adopt my original site design. Some of these challenges include moving navbar elements to different locations and aligning the height of image overlay cards. Others weren't as successful and require further investigation, like the border radius maintaining an internal right angle for each hover element in the Work section and the amount of movement in the rows when hovering over each card.

You will also notice only one piece of work is live in my portfolio. The others will open the portfolio again in a new tab. I intend to update these as future work is completed, while also updating features of the portfolio site itself to further demonstrate my progress and commitment to showcasing my growing Front End Web Development skills.
